<p class="thisis"> This is a site created to introduce people to things that lack attention. So we could all start hearing what is happening around us. It is nothing new, but the only way to stop them is by listening. Silence is the base in which hatred breeds.</p>
<p class="thisis"> People are fighting for causes all around the world. It is up to us to speak up.</p>
<p class="thisis"> Martin Luther King Jr., who was often praised for his peaceful protesting, referred to riots as “the language of the unheard” in  <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mlk-a-riot-is-the-language-of-the-unheard/">an interview with CBS News in 1966</a>.<br><br> America has evolved and policies have changed, but riots have persisted and for good reason. Oppression, referring to prolonged unjust treatment, takes its toll. When people in power fail to address the problems facing the oppressed, who are very often marginalized and minority individuals, an uprising will inevitably happen.

Violence is not a preferred action by protestors, but rather a consequence of being ignored, criticized, and oppressed after numerous attempts to be seen and heard. </p>
