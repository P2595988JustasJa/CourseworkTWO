<h2 class="heading1"> Extradiction bill </h2>
<p class="para1"> &nbsp;&nbsp; The extradition bill which triggered the first protest was introduced in April, 2018. It would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China under certain circumstances.
Opponents said this risked exposing Hongkongers to unfair trials and violent treatment. They also argued the bill would give China greater influence over Hong Kong and could be used to target activists and journalists.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. After weeks of protests, leader Carrie Lam eventually said the bill would be suspended indefinitely.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely.
By then clashes between police and protesters had become more frequent and violent.
In September, the bill was finally withdrawn, but protesters said this was "too little, too late".
On 1 October, while China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule, Hong Kong experienced one of its most "violent and chaotic days".
An 18-year-old was shot in the chest with a live bullet as protesters fought officers with poles, petrol bombs and other projectiles.
The government then banned protesters wearing face masks, and in early November a pro-Beijing lawmaker was stabbed in the street by a man pretending to be a supporter.
One week later, a policeman shot one protester at close range when activists were trying to set up a road block. Later that day another man was set on fire by anti-government protesters.
In November, a standoff between police and students barricaded on the campus of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University became another defining moment.
Later that month, the territory held local council elections that were seen as a barometer of public opinion.
The vote saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49317695">Anon, 2019</a> </p>

 <p class="para2">  Some protesters have adopted the motto: "Five demands, not one less!" These are:<br>
 -For the protests not to be characterised as a "riot" <br><br>
 -Amnesty for arrested protesters <br><br>
 -An independent inquiry into alleged police brutality <br><br>
 -Implementation of complete universal suffrage <br><br>
 -The fifth demand, the withdrawal of the bill, has already been met. <br><br>
 Protests supporting the Hong Kong movement have spread across the globe, with rallies taking place in the UK, France, US, Canada and Australia.
 In many cases, people supporting the demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies.
 Chinese president Xi Jinping has warned against separatism, saying any attempt to divide China would end in "bodies smashed and bones ground to powder". <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49317695">Anon, 2019</a></p>
